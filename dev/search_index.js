By default, ODBC.jl will use iODBC as driver manager on OSX, unixODBC on Linux platforms, and the system-provided driver manager on Windows.

ODBC.jl tries to stick with the most generally accepted defaults which is using the UTF-16 encoding in unixODBC and Windows, and using UTF-32 for OSX with iODBC. Sometimes, specific drivers will have configurations or allow datasource connection parameters to alter these. We don't recommend changing to anything but the defaults, but sometimes there are defaults shipped with drivers that don't match ODBC.jl's defaults. One example is the Impala ODBC driver on linux, which is correctly built against unixODBC (default driver manager on linux), but then sets a property DriverManagerEncoding=UTF-32 in the /opt/cloudera/impalaodbc/lib/64/cloudera.impalaodbc.ini file which messes things up (since ODBC.jl tries to use UTF-16). This examples shows that there may be driver-provided configuration files that make affect things that sometimes take some digging to figure out.

Column definitions can also be enhanced by providing arguments to columnsuffix as a Dict of  column name (given as a Symbol) to a string of the enhancement that will come after name and type like [column name] [column type] enhancements.
